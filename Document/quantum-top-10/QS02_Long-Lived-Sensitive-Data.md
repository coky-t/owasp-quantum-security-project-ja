## QS02:2026 - 長期間有効な機密データ (Long-Lived Sensitive Data)

**説明:**

Data with a confidentiality requirement that extends past the projected arrival of a CRQC cannot be protected by today's public-key primitives alone. Mosca's inequality is the operative planning frame: if the time to migrate to quantum-safe cryptography (X) plus the required confidentiality lifetime of the data (Y) exceeds the time until a CRQC exists (Z), the organisation is already exposed. For data with multi-decade confidentiality requirements - archives, backups, regulated personal data, identity records, intellectual property, signed material whose integrity must hold for years - current public-key protection is insufficient regardless of exactly when a CRQC arrives. This is distinct from QS01: it focuses on stored data and signed artefacts whose protection requirements outlast any reasonable migration window, rather than in-flight traffic.

**脆弱性のよくある例:**

1. Major data categories where confidentiality lifetime plus migration lead time exceeds published government CRQC planning horizons (2030-2035 for most regulators).
2. Archives and backups that pre-date current crypto policy and may contain quantum-vulnerable encryption under long retention requirements.
3. Signed artefacts whose validity must persist for years: contracts, regulatory filings, evidentiary records, signed software releases, blockchain transactions.
4. Identity and credential records with multi-year lifetimes: government identity issuance, professional credentials, root certificates.
5. Data-at-rest encrypted with AES-256 but wrapped with an RSA or ECC key - the quantum-vulnerable layer sits above the symmetric key.

**防御方法:**

1. Establish data classification by confidentiality lifetime, not just sensitivity - a medium-sensitivity record with a 30-year retention requirement may outrank a high-sensitivity record retained for two years.
2. Plan re-encryption programmes for high-priority archives, sequenced against migration capacity.
3. For long-lived signed artefacts, plan re-signing or counter-signing with PQC schemes (ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) before classical signature schemes are deprecated.
4. Where re-encryption is not feasible, reduce retention to the minimum legally and operationally required.

**攻撃シナリオの例:**

Scenario #1: A regulated entity retains personal records for a statutory 30-year period, encrypted with an RSA-wrapped AES key. An adversary harvests the encrypted store today. Applying Mosca's inequality, the confidentiality lifetime far exceeds the CRQC horizon, so the records are effectively already compromised: the attacker recovers the wrapping key once a CRQC exists and decrypts the full archive, well within its required protection window.

Scenario #2: A vendor issues software releases signed with ECDSA, with signatures expected to remain valid for the product's decade-long support lifetime. An attacker records the signed artefacts and, after a CRQC becomes available, forges signatures on malicious updates that still validate against the long-lived, un-rotated trust anchor.
