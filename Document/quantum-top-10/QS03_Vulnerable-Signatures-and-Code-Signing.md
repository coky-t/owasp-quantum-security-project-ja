## QS03:2026 - 脆弱なシグネチャとコード署名 (Vulnerable Signatures and Code-Signing)

**説明:**

Public-key signatures underpin code signing, supply-chain integrity, document validity, identity certificates, transactions, and long-term non-repudiation. RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA are all broken by Shor's algorithm, so any system that verifies these signatures to establish trust - software updates, container images, firmware, package managers, TLS certificate hierarchies, SBOM attestations, signed documents, blockchain transactions - is at risk once a CRQC exists. Unlike confidentiality breaches, signature forgery enables active attacks: malicious updates, fake identities, fraudulent transactions, supply-chain compromise. The post-quantum signature standards (ML-DSA / FIPS 204 and SLH-DSA / FIPS 205) have larger keys and signatures and different operational profiles, with non-trivial impact on hardware roots of trust, constrained devices, and certificate ecosystems.

The same Mosca's-inequality logic that governs confidentiality exposure (QS01) applies to signature trust, with the inequality read against integrity rather than secrecy: if the time to migrate (X) plus the period a signature or credential must remain trustworthy (Y) exceeds the time until a CRQC exists (Z), that signature is already exposed. Contracts, regulatory filings, evidentiary records, signed software releases, and long-lived identity or credential issuance - government identity, professional credentials, root certificates - routinely carry validity periods long enough to fail this test today, independent of when a CRQC actually arrives.

This scope also includes re-establishment failure: a migration can complete correctly on every cryptographic measure - the new signature verifies, the new certificate chains, the algorithm is compliant - while the process that issued the new credential accepted the wrong evidence to do so. An enrolment flow that takes proof-of-possession from a key this entry already classifies as forgeable, and issues a strong new credential on the strength of it, produces two certificates that both verify and a record indistinguishable from a correct migration. The risk is not that the signature fails; it is that the re-issuance accepted a compromised anchor as sufficient authority to mint its replacement. Prevention item 7 below is the mitigation for this failure mode specifically.

**脆弱性のよくある例:**

1. Certification authority hierarchies (root, intermediate, issuing CA) signing with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256 over multi-year validity periods.
2. Code-signing keys: OS update signing, firmware signing, container image signing (Sigstore, cosign, Notary), package signing, mobile app signing, CI/CD signing.
3. Other long-lived signature trust anchors: UEFI Secure Boot keys, TPM endorsement keys, JWT/SAML issuer keys, document-signing certificates, blockchain wallet keys.
4. Large verifier populations - devices, services, or artefacts - that trust a classical key and cannot easily be upgraded.
5. Long-lived signed artefacts whose validity must persist for years - contracts, regulatory filings, evidentiary records, signed software releases, blockchain transactions - where confidentiality-style Mosca's-inequality reasoning applied to integrity shows the artefact is already exposed.
6. Identity and credential records with multi-year lifetimes - government identity issuance, professional credentials, root certificates - signed with a classical algorithm and expected to remain trustworthy well past any reasonable migration window.

**防御方法:**

1. Migrate code-signing and CA hierarchies before broader estate migration - they have the longest blast radius and lead time.
2. Adopt hybrid signing during transition: produce both a classical and a PQC signature on the same artefact so non-PQC verifiers keep working while PQC-aware verifiers gain forward security.
3. Use ML-DSA (FIPS 204) for general digital signatures; use SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) for very long-lived, high-assurance signatures where stateless hash-based security is preferred.
4. Plan for shorter certificate lifetimes during transition (e.g. the CA/Browser Forum 47-day TLS maximum effective 2029) to reduce the exposure window.
5. Engage PKI, code-signing, and certificate-authority vendors on PQC roadmaps - failure here is a supply-chain blocker.
6. For firmware and software signing specifically, CNSA 2.0 lists LMS and XMSS (NIST SP 800-208) as the approved stateful hash-based schemes, and does not approve SLH-DSA for NSS use (SLH-DSA remains valid per FIPS 205 outside that scope - item 3 above still applies generally). This approval covers single-tree LMS and XMSS only - HSS and XMSS^MT, the multi-tree variants, are not approved for NSS use, even though they are the more common library default for high signature counts. ML-DSA is also CNSA 2.0-approved for this use case and may suit setups needing more signatures than a single LMS/XMSS key can produce, or distributed signing. LMS and XMSS are stateful: each key can produce only a fixed number of signatures, and reusing a state index breaks the security guarantee. State management should be handled in hardware such as an HSM, and any flow that transfers or duplicates key material - backup, restore, failover - must guarantee state is never reused.
7. For long-lived signed artefacts already failing the Mosca's-inequality test - contracts, filings, releases, and other fixed-content documents - plan re-signing or counter-signing with PQC schemes (ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) before the classical signature scheme is deprecated, rather than treating the artefact as settled once issued. Re-signing is sufficient here because the artefact's content is unchanged; the new signature only re-attests something that was already true.
8. For long-lived credentials failing the same test, do not treat re-signing as equivalent to remediation. A credential asserts that a named subject controls a key, and a PQC signature over the same claim only re-asserts it with stronger cryptography - it does not re-establish the claim itself. Require re-issuance to rest on evidence independent of the credential being replaced (fresh identity proofing, a still-trusted anchor, or hardware attestation), not on the outgoing key vouching for its own successor.

**攻撃シナリオの例:**

Scenario #1: An attacker with a future CRQC recovers the private key of a code-signing certificate still on ECDSA P-256. They sign malware that passes verification on every device trusting that anchor, distributing a malicious "update" through the legitimate update channel.

Scenario #2: An organisation migrates its leaf TLS certificates to PQC but leaves the root and intermediate CAs on RSA. An attacker forges an intermediate CA signature with a CRQC and issues trusted certificates for arbitrary domains - the chain is only as strong as its weakest classical link.

Scenario #3: A vendor issues software releases signed with ECDSA, with signatures expected to remain valid for the product's decade-long support lifetime. Once a CRQC exists, an attacker recovers the signing key and forges signatures on malicious updates that still validate against the long-lived, un-rotated trust anchor - the artefact was exposed from the day it was signed, under the same Mosca's-inequality logic that governs confidentiality.
