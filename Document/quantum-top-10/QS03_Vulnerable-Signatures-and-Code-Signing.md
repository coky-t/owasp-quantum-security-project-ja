## QS03:2026 - 脆弱なシグネチャとコード署名 (Vulnerable Signatures and Code-Signing)

**説明:**

Public-key signatures underpin code signing, supply-chain integrity, document validity, identity certificates, transactions, and long-term non-repudiation. RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA are all broken by Shor's algorithm, so any system that verifies these signatures to establish trust - software updates, container images, firmware, package managers, TLS certificate hierarchies, SBOM attestations, signed documents, blockchain transactions - is at risk once a CRQC exists. Unlike confidentiality breaches, signature forgery enables active attacks: malicious updates, fake identities, fraudulent transactions, supply-chain compromise. The post-quantum signature standards (ML-DSA / FIPS 204 and SLH-DSA / FIPS 205) have larger keys and signatures and different operational profiles, with non-trivial impact on hardware roots of trust, constrained devices, and certificate ecosystems.

**脆弱性のよくある例:**

1. Certification authority hierarchies (root, intermediate, issuing CA) signing with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256 over multi-year validity periods.
2. Code-signing keys: OS update signing, firmware signing, container image signing (Sigstore, cosign, Notary), package signing, mobile app signing, CI/CD signing.
3. Other long-lived signature trust anchors: UEFI Secure Boot keys, TPM endorsement keys, JWT/SAML issuer keys, document-signing certificates, blockchain wallet keys.
4. Large verifier populations - devices, services, or artefacts - that trust a classical key and cannot easily be upgraded.

**防御方法:**

1. Migrate code-signing and CA hierarchies before broader estate migration - they have the longest blast radius and lead time.
2. Adopt hybrid signing during transition: produce both a classical and a PQC signature on the same artefact so non-PQC verifiers keep working while PQC-aware verifiers gain forward security.
3. Use ML-DSA (FIPS 204) for general digital signatures; use SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) for very long-lived, high-assurance signatures where stateless hash-based security is preferred.
4. Plan for shorter certificate lifetimes during transition (e.g. the CA/Browser Forum 47-day TLS maximum effective 2029) to reduce the exposure window.
5. Engage PKI, code-signing, and certificate-authority vendors on PQC roadmaps - failure here is a supply-chain blocker.

**攻撃シナリオの例:**

Scenario #1: An attacker with a future CRQC recovers the private key of a code-signing certificate still on ECDSA P-256. They sign malware that passes verification on every device trusting that anchor, distributing a malicious "update" through the legitimate update channel.

Scenario #2: An organisation migrates its leaf TLS certificates to PQC but leaves the root and intermediate CAs on RSA. An attacker forges an intermediate CA signature with a CRQC and issues trusted certificates for arbitrary domains - the chain is only as strong as its weakest classical link.
