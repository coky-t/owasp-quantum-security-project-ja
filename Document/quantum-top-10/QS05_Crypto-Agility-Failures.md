## QS05:2026 - 暗号アジリティの失敗 (Crypto-Agility Failures)

**説明:**

Cryptographic agility is the engineering property that allows an algorithm, key size, or parameter set to be replaced without rebuilding the system around it. Most production systems hard-code cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, parameter sets, and key formats deep in code, configuration, hardware, and protocols. Systems that lack agility - algorithms baked into source, protocol logic, custom data formats, or non-updatable firmware - require replacement, not migration. As ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA move into production and parameter sets continue to evolve through subsequent NIST rounds (Falcon, HQC, others), organisations without negotiable algorithms, abstracted crypto APIs, version-aware protocols, and dynamic policy will be unable to respond to standards updates, broken parameter sets, or future migrations. Crypto-agility is itself a security control. Like any other control, it must have a named owner, a governing policy, and a measurable definition of agility: a system can be technically agile but operationally unable to exercise that agility if no one is held accountable for authorising, driving, verifying and validating cryptographic changes.

Symmetric primitives are more quantum-resilient, but "quantum is only a public-key problem" must not be read as "symmetric needs no work": AES key sizes, hash strengths, MAC lengths, and KDFs all need review end-to-end.

**脆弱性のよくある例:**

1. Hard-coded algorithm identifiers in source: `RSA`, `sha256WithRSAEncryption`, explicit OIDs embedded in protocol logic.
2. Proprietary protocols that fix algorithms rather than negotiate them (unlike TLS 1.3).
3. Embedded devices with no tested path to receive firmware updates that change cryptographic primitives.
4. Systems that cannot select among ML-KEM-512/768/1024 parameter sets without code changes.
5. Symmetric weaknesses left unaddressed: AES-128 on long-lived links, truncated MACs, weak KDFs, unsafe key derivation in hybrid KEMs.

**防御方法:**

1. Refactor algorithm selection out of business logic into a cryptographic abstraction layer.
2. Standardise on libraries that ship PQC: OpenSSL 3.x with PQC providers, BoringSSL, SymCrypt, JDK 24+, .NET 10+.
3. Avoid custom protocol implementations where standard alternatives exist - prefer TLS 1.3 with hybrid PQC cipher suites over a bespoke handshake.
4. Test the rotation path end-to-end in non-production, including embedded and mobile clients, to surface agility blockers before migration.
5. Include agility requirements in procurement: new contracts should require PQC support and demonstrable algorithm replacement on a defined timescale.
6. Track IETF PQUIP and TLS working-group output for documented migration patterns and failure modes.
7. Assign accountable owner and develop governing policy for cryptographic change, identify who will authorise it and maintain a tested runbook for time-pressure events.
8. Make agility measurable and inventory-bounded: track cryptographic time-to-rotate (cMTTR) as the primary metric, capped by the share of the estate visible in the CBOM (QS04), with abstraction-layer coverage and negotiation posture reported wherever useful.

**攻撃シナリオの例:**

Scenario #1: A NIST parameter set for a deployed PQC algorithm is later found weak. An organisation that hard-coded the algorithm cannot swap it without a full rebuild-and-reship cycle across firmware it cannot update in the field, leaving vulnerable systems exposed for the length of a replacement project.

Scenario #2: A team adds a crypto abstraction layer but never tests rotation. When migration day arrives, an embedded client that pins a classical algorithm identifier silently fails PQC negotiation and continues on classical crypto, and the untested "agility" turns out to be theoretical - the attacker targets the client that never actually migrated.

Scenario #3: An organisation has an abstraction layer, negotiable protocols, and a documented rotation runbook. Therefore, technically it is agile. No accountable owner is assigned to watch the triggers, so a broken parameter set, a CNSA 2.0 milestone, and a binding regulatory deadline all pass unobserved, and the runbook is not opened until an audit forces the question. The exposure is undetected triggers rather than slow execution. By then, the organisation is in breach with a rotation it has never timed against the deadline.
