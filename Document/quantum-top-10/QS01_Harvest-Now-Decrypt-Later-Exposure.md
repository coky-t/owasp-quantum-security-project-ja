## QS01:2026 - Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later の露出 (Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later Exposure)

**説明:**

Adversaries are already capturing encrypted traffic and stored ciphertext today, retaining it for future decryption once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) exists. The relevant operation is typically a key-establishment step protected by RSA, finite-field Diffie-Hellman, or elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman - all broken in polynomial time by Shor's algorithm. Once the session key or wrapping key is recovered, the symmetric ciphertext it protects follows. This entry covers the full harvest surface: data captured **in transit**, where an adversary records ciphertext as it crosses an untrusted network boundary, and data already sitting **at rest**, where an adversary can exfiltrate an existing encrypted store at any point before a CRQC exists and simply wait. Both are the same exposure - ciphertext an adversary can obtain now, protected by an algorithm that fails later - differing only in where the ciphertext currently resides.

Mosca's inequality is the operative planning frame for both surfaces: if the time to migrate to quantum-safe cryptography (X) plus the required confidentiality lifetime of the data (Y) exceeds the time until a CRQC exists (Z), the data is already exposed regardless of exactly when a CRQC arrives. For in-transit data this determines how urgently a channel needs migrating; for at-rest data - archives, backups, regulated personal data, identity records, intellectual property - it determines how urgently existing stores need re-encryption, since a record with a multi-decade retention requirement can fail this inequality today even if migration starts immediately. Any organisation whose data has meaningful confidentiality lifetime - financial records, health data, source code, intelligence material, contractual or commercial secrets - must treat current TLS, VPN, and at-rest encryption based on these primitives as future-readable. The risk is concrete now, not contingent on quantum hardware availability.

**脆弱性のよくある例:**

1. Data sets whose confidentiality requirement extends beyond the CRQC planning horizon most regulators use (2030-2035) - health records, intellectual property, regulated personal data with long retention, government and defence data - protected only by classical public-key cryptography, whether in transit or already stored.
2. Transport and channel protection using vulnerable key establishment: TLS endpoints, VPN tunnels, encrypted backup channels, and satellite or microwave links relying on RSA, ECDH, or finite-field DH, traversing an untrusted boundary where they can be passively recorded and retained.
3. Archives and backups that pre-date current crypto policy, held under long retention requirements, where confidentiality lifetime plus migration lead time already exceeds the CRQC horizon by Mosca's inequality.
4. Data at rest encrypted with AES-256 but wrapped with an RSA or ECC key - the quantum-vulnerable layer sits above the symmetric key, so the attacker's target is the wrapping key, not the cipher.
5. Session encryption migrated to PQC while long-validity certificates and key-wrapping keys protecting archived data are left on classical algorithms.

**防御方法:**

1. Migrate vulnerable channels to hybrid post-quantum TLS using ML-KEM (FIPS 203) where the platform supports it.
2. Classify data by confidentiality lifetime, not just sensitivity - a medium-sensitivity record with a 30-year retention requirement may outrank a high-sensitivity record retained for two years, and Mosca's inequality is the tool for making that ranking explicit.
3. For the highest-priority archives identified by that classification, layer a PQC-protected encryption envelope over the existing classical encryption, sequenced against migration capacity.
4. Rotate symmetric data keys protected by quantum-vulnerable wrapping more frequently, to reduce the volume of data exposed by the recovery of any single wrapping key.
5. Reduce data retention where the business case allows - data not retained cannot be harvested or decrypted later.

**攻撃シナリオの例:**

Scenario #1: An adversary passively records TLS-protected traffic as it crosses an untrusted network boundary today. The handshake used RSA or ECDH key establishment. The captured ciphertext is archived. Once a CRQC becomes available, the adversary recovers the session key via Shor's algorithm and decrypts years of previously confidential traffic retroactively.

Scenario #2: A regulated entity retains personal records for a statutory 30-year period, encrypted with an RSA-wrapped AES key, held at rest rather than transmitted. An adversary exfiltrates the encrypted store today - no interception is needed, since the ciphertext already sits somewhere reachable. Applying Mosca's inequality, the confidentiality lifetime alone exceeds the CRQC horizon, so the records are effectively already compromised: the attacker recovers the wrapping key once a CRQC exists and decrypts the full archive, well within its required protection window.
