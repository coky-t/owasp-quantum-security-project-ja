## QS01:2026 - Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later の露出 (Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later Exposure)

**説明:**

Adversaries are already capturing encrypted traffic and stored ciphertext today, retaining it for future decryption once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) exists. The relevant operation is typically a key-establishment step protected by RSA, finite-field Diffie-Hellman, or elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman - all broken in polynomial time by Shor's algorithm. Once the session key is recovered, the symmetric ciphertext follows. Any organisation whose data has meaningful confidentiality lifetime - financial records, health data, source code, intelligence material, contractual or commercial secrets - must treat current TLS, VPN, and at-rest encryption based on these primitives as future-readable. The risk is concrete now, not contingent on quantum hardware availability.

**脆弱性のよくある例:**

1. Data sets whose confidentiality requirement extends beyond 2030 - health records, intellectual property, regulated personal data with long retention, government and defence data - protected only by classical public-key cryptography.
2. Transport and channel protection using vulnerable key establishment: TLS endpoints, VPN tunnels, encrypted backup channels, archival storage encryption, and satellite or microwave links relying on RSA, ECDH, or finite-field DH.
3. Encrypted traffic transiting an untrusted boundary where it can be passively recorded and retained for later decryption.
4. Session encryption migrated to PQC while long-validity certificates and key-wrapping keys are left on classical algorithms.

**防御方法:**

1. Migrate vulnerable channels to hybrid post-quantum TLS using ML-KEM (FIPS 203) where the platform supports it.
2. For data at rest, layer a PQC-protected encryption envelope over existing classical encryption for the highest-sensitivity datasets.
3. Rotate symmetric data keys protected by quantum-vulnerable wrapping more frequently to reduce the volume exposed by any single recovered key.
4. Reduce data retention where the business case allows - data not retained cannot be decrypted later.

**攻撃シナリオの例:**

Scenario #1: An adversary passively records TLS-protected traffic as it crosses an untrusted network boundary today. The handshake used RSA or ECDH key establishment. The captured ciphertext is archived. Once a CRQC becomes available, the adversary recovers the session key via Shor's algorithm and decrypts years of previously confidential traffic retroactively.

Scenario #2: An organisation encrypts long-retention backups at rest with AES-256, but the AES data key is wrapped with RSA. An attacker exfiltrates the encrypted backups and the wrapped keys. Because the quantum-vulnerable layer is the RSA key-wrapping - not the symmetric cipher - the attacker recovers the wrapping key with a future CRQC and unwraps the AES keys, exposing the entire archive.
